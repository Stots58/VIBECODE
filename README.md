# VibeCoding
### I built a Pacman type of game called "Avoiding Your Extroverted Friends", where you must avoid bots and get to the end of a maze to win.
### The languages I used were JS, HTML, and CSS.
### The AI cites I used were ChatGPT and Claude. I gave GPT the basic idea for the code, and it got some working logic, but Claud was mainly making the UI way better for looks and playability.
### Well, when I gave Claude my basic code, my file went from 150ish lines to 700+, which was cool, but trying to fix very simple errors took forever to do. So I had to go back to a previous iteration of the game code, and I made it better.
### The one thing I'm proud of is the patthing system. Even though it's not the best, those bugs make the game fun.
### I would improve the bot pathing. They try and reach the player through the maze, and they don't always try and get you. Fixing this would allow me to make a bigger map and a more robust game.
